## Abstract

Software developers, researchers, trainers, and outreach staff will
meet to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities for
developing and promoting software engineering practices, including the
development of reusable software to enhance the computational science
and engineering ecosystem for HPC systems to accelerate the "time to
science".

The BoF attendees will help develop an international "community of
practice" to share experiences in developing quality software,
gathering community feedback, addressing interoperability, and
promoting software to applications developers and users.

We will identify strategies for ongoing efforts to inform, engage, and
benefit the community and thereby advance the HPC software ecosystem.
