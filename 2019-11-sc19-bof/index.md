## Abstract

Software engineering (SWE) for modeling, simulation, and data
analytics for computational science and engineering (CSE) is
challenging, with ever-more sophisticated, higher fidelity simulation
of ever-larger, more complex problems involving larger data volumes,
more domains, and more researchers. Targeting both commodity and
custom high-end computers multiplies these challenges. We invest
significantly in creating these codes, but rarely talk about that
experience; we just focus on the results.

We seek to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a major
challenge, and develop an international "community of practice" to
continue these important discussions outside of workshops and other
"traditional" venues.
