## Abstract

Software engineering (SWE) for computational science and engineering (CSE) is challenging, with ever-more sophisticated, higher fidelity simulation of ever-larger and more complex problems involving larger data volumes, more domains and more researchers. Targeting high-end computers multiplies these challenges. We invest a great deal in creating these codes, but we rarely talk about that experience. Instead we focus on the results.

Our goal is to raise awareness of SWE for CSE on supercomputers as a major challenge, and to begin the development of an international "community of practice" to continue these important discussions outside of annual workshops and other "traditional" venues.
